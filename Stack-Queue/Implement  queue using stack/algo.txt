Implement Queue using stack:

Use an extra stack
enQueue(q,  x)
  1) Push x to stack1 (assuming size of stacks is unlimited).

deQueue(q)
  1) If both stacks are empty then error.
  2) If stack2 is empty
       While stack1 is not empty, push everything from stack1 to stack2.
  3) Pop the element from stack2 and return it.

Worst case Complexity:
Enqueue: Time complexity: O(1)
	Space complexity: O(n)

Dequeue: Time Complexity: O(n)
	 Spacce complexity 1: O(n)
