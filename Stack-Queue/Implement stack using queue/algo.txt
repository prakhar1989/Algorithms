Implement queue using stack:

1. This is opposite to implemetation of stack using queue.
2. We can implement stack datastructure using two queues.

Algo:

// using two queues

push(s,  x)
  1) Enqueue x to q1 (assuming size of q1 is unlimited).

pop(s)  
  1) One by one dequeue everything except the last element from q1 and enqueue to q2.
  2) Dequeue the last item of q1, the dequeued item is result, store it.
  3) Swap the names of q1 and q2
  4) Return the item stored in step 2.
// Swapping of names is done to avoid one more movement of all elements 
// from q2 to q1.

// using single queue

push(s, x)
  1) assume size of queue is l;
  2) enqueue x into the queue
  3) one by one dequeue elements in queue and again enqueue it

pop(s)
  1) dequeue element from queue
